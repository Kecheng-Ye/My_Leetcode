# Sliding Window

* Template

```cpp
int left = 0, right = 0;

while (right < s.size()) {
    window.add(s[right]);
    right++;

    while (not valid) {
        window.remove(s[left]);
        left++;
    }

    // update window size
}
```

Above is the specific problem that can be solved by two pointers. Now let's generalize the characteristics of the problems that can be solved by two pointers. The summary is simple:

1. If a wider scope of the sliding window is valid, the narrower scope of that wider scope is valid mush hold.
2. If a narrower scope of the sliding window is invalid, the wider scope of that narrower scope is invalid mush hold.
